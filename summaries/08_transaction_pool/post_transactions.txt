Create the equivalent method that actually adds new transactions to the transaction pool, in app/index.js:
```
app.post('/transact', (req, res) => {
  const { recipient, amount } = req.body;
  const transaction = wallet.createTransaction(recipient, amount, tp);
  res.redirect('/transactions');
});
```

$ npm run dev

- Test a POST request in postman, with raw application/json set as the Body data. Use some json similar to this for the data:
```
{
	"recipient": "foo-4dr3ss",
	"amount": 50
}
```

- Hit the endpoint a couple times
