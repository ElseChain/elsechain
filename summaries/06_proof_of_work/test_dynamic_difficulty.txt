Test difficulty adjustment in `block.test.js`:
```

it('lowers the difficulty for slowly mined blocks', () => {
  expect(Block.adjustDifficulty(block, block.timestamp+360000)).toEqual(block.difficulty-1);
});

it('raises the difficulty for quickly mined blocks', () => {
  expect(Block.adjustDifficulty(block, block.timestamp+1)).toEqual(block.difficulty+1);
});

```
Also update the test that previously depended on `DIFFICULTY`, since blocks have their own `difficulty` attribute:
```
it('generates a hash that matches the difficulty', () => {
 	expect(block.hash.substring(0, block.difficulty)).toEqual('0'.repeat(block.difficulty));
});
```
Also delete this unnecessary line:
```
const { DIFFICULTY } = require('../config'); // ‚Üê  remove
```
