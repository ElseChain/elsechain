Test the proof-of-work system.

First make a config.js file at the root of the project so that the `DIFFICULTY` constant can be shared. Cut and paste the `DIFFICULTY` constant from block.js:
Create config.js:
```
// cut and paste from block.js
const DIFFICULTY = 4;
module.exports = { DIFFICULTY };
```
In block.js, require the `DIFFICULTY` constant:
```
// at the top
const { DIFFICULTY } = require('../config');
```

Then in block.test.js, add new unit tests:
```
// Next to the other requirements
const { DIFFICULTY } = require('../config');
...
it('generates a hash that matches the difficulty', () => {
	expect(block.hash.substring(0, DIFFICULTY)).toEqual('0'.repeat(DIFFICULTY));
});
```
$ npm run test
